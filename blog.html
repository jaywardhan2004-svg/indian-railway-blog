    <h2>History of Indian Railways</h2>
    <p>The history of trains in India began on April 16, 1853, when the first passenger train ran between Bori Bunder (Mumbai) and Thane, covering a distance of 34 kilometers. It was pulled by three steam locomotives — Sahib, Sindh, and Sultan.

This small beginning marked the birth of one of the largest railway networks in the world. The British developed the railway system to transport goods and raw materials, but soon it became a lifeline for people across India. After independence, the Indian Railways was nationalized in 1951 and has since grown into a massive network connecting every corner of the country.

Today, trains are not just a mode of transport — they are a symbol of India’s unity, progress, and diversity..</p>
